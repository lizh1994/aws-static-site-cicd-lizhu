# AWS Static Site CI/CD

A fully automated GitHub ‚Üí AWS CI/CD pipeline for hosting a static site with CloudFront Functions, S3 Versioning, and Least Privilege IAM policies. This project demonstrates building and deploying a static website with real-time alerts and secure deployment.

## üõ† Key Features

GitHub ‚Üí AWS CI/CD Integration ‚Äî Fully automated static site deployment pipeline.

CloudFront Functions ‚Äî Path rewriting, simple access control, and caching optimization.

S3 Versioning ‚Äî Automatic version tracking for static assets.

IAM Least Privilege ‚Äî Fine-grained IAM policies to secure the CI/CD pipeline.

CodeBuild Integration ‚Äî Executes build commands to sync website files.

CloudWatch + SNS Alerts ‚Äî Proactive failure notifications for deployments.

## üîê IAM Roles & Least Privilege Principle

This project applies least privilege IAM policies to ensure secure CI/CD operations.

- **CodeBuild Role**
  - **Permissions:**
    - Read/Write artifacts in pipeline S3 bucket (no delete).
    - Full sync (Get/Put/Delete/List) on deploy S3 bucket.
    - Write logs to CloudWatch.
    - Create build reports.
  - **Purpose:** Ensures CodeBuild can update the deployed site but cannot accidentally delete intermediate pipeline artifacts.  

- **CodePipeline Role**
  - **Permissions:**
    - Access artifacts in pipeline bucket.
    - Use GitHub connection via CodeStar Connections.
    - Start CodeBuild projects.
    - Deploy artifacts to the target S3 bucket.
  - **Purpose:** CI/CD orchestrator with just enough access to fetch, build, and deploy.

## ‚ú® Additional Enhancements

- **CloudFront Functions**  
  Path rewrite, simple access control, and cache optimization.  

- **S3 Versioning**  
  Automatic version tracking for static site assets.  

- **CloudWatch + SNS**  
  Real-time failure alerting.

## üí° Coordination with S3 Bucket Policy

While the deploy bucket‚Äôs policy only allows public `GetObject` for website visitors, the CodeBuild IAM role has broader permissions (write, delete, list).  

This separation ensures **visitors can only read**, while **the pipeline can fully manage deployments**.

## üéØ Lessons Learned

1. IAM Permissions: Learned to balance least privilege with task feasibility. Many failures came from missing permissions, which pushed me to clarify the exact boundaries of each role.

2. Troubleshooting: Developed the habit of checking error logs first and fixing issues systematically instead of guessing.

3. Service Interactions: Realized the importance of mapping how services pass data. For example, forgetting build artifact output caused repeated deploy failures until I fixed the build stage.

### Key takeaway: Hands-on practice, combined with a problem-solving mindset, is the most effective way to learn AWS.
