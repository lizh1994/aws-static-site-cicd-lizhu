# AWS Static Site CI/CD

A fully automated GitHub ‚Üí AWS CI/CD pipeline for hosting a static site with CloudFront Functions, S3 Versioning, and Least Privilege IAM policies. This project demonstrates building and deploying a static website with real-time alerts and secure deployment.

## üõ† Key Features

GitHub ‚Üí AWS CI/CD Integration ‚Äî Fully automated static site deployment pipeline.

CloudFront Functions ‚Äî Path rewriting, simple access control, and caching optimization.

S3 Versioning ‚Äî Automatic version tracking for static assets.

IAM Least Privilege ‚Äî Fine-grained IAM policies to secure the CI/CD pipeline.

CodeBuild Integration ‚Äî Executes buildspec tasks to sync website files.

CloudWatch + SNS Alerts ‚Äî Proactive failure notifications for deployments.

## üîê IAM Roles & Least Privilege Principle

This project applies least privilege IAM policies to ensure secure CI/CD operations.

- **CodeBuild Role**
  - **Permissions:**
    - Read/Write artifacts in pipeline S3 bucket (no delete).
    - Full sync (Get/Put/Delete/List) on deploy S3 bucket.
    - Write logs to CloudWatch.
    - Create build reports.
  - **Purpose:** Ensures CodeBuild can update the deployed site but cannot accidentally delete intermediate pipeline artifacts.  
  - **Summary:** `CodeBuild ‚Üí Sync to deploy S3 (with DeleteObject) + write logs.`

- **CodePipeline Role**
  - **Permissions:**
    - Access artifacts in pipeline bucket.
    - Use GitHub connection via CodeStar Connections.
    - Start CodeBuild projects.
    - Deploy artifacts to the target S3 bucket.
  - **Purpose:** CI/CD orchestrator with just enough access to fetch, build, and deploy.  
  - **Summary:** `CodePipeline ‚Üí Orchestrates stages: fetch GitHub, trigger CodeBuild, deploy to S3.`
